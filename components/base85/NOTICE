The implementation in this folder was copied/derived from https://github.com/Sheep-y/Base85.
The original license remains: Apache License v2.0 (see the license file in this folder)

We modified the code in a few areas:
- removed Base85 variants we don't use (Ascii85, Z85) leaving only the RFC-1924 implementation
- fixed the unit tests accordingly
- refactored the remaining unit tests to use JUnit 5
